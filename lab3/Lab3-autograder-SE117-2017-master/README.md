# Lab3 Auto-grader
This auto-grader is used for lab3 of _Programming and Data Structure_ course (SE117, 2017) at School of Software Engineering, SJTU.

## Test your code

Create `/reports`, `/submits` directories under grader's root directory.

Rename your _Word Ladder_ implementation in such format as `wordLadder+studentId+yourName.cpp` and put it under `submits` directory.

Run `python3 ./auto-grader.py` in terminal and your test results should be prompted soon.

## Notice

Please pay attention to the format of program's output. Minor error, such as missing dot at the end of sentence, will result in an `unexpected result`.

Grader has a timeout of **10 secs** for each trace. Please make sure that you have chosen an efficient algorithm for this lab.
